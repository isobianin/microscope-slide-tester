# Microscope slide tester

This is a small project done in collaboration with [Igor Kraev](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/igor-kraev-78a55821) from the Open University Microscope Suite. The device at hand is a simple continuity tester which is equipped with
a battery holder and can be recharged.

The protocol of operation:

1. Take the electrode lid off.

2. Clean your electrodes with either distilled water, acetone or IPA to remove any dust particles.

3. Press the slide against the electrodes. **If the front LED lights up, the side that is in contact with electrodes is conductive**.

4. Mark the conductive side.

5. Repeat steps 1-4 for as many slides as needed.

6. When done, close the electrode lid.

The tester can be operated while being charged

# Recharging and safety

The tester can be recharged from any USB port (5V). That includes a PC, a laptop or even a phone charger. In the baseline version, USB B is installed at the back of the teste. It
can be swapped for any other convenient connector. USB A to USB B is a quite common cable and can be found in lots of printers, scanners, in electronic workshops, etc.

There are no specific regulations for the battery charging. When the tester is being charged, an indicator in the back lights up. A so-called **"trickle charge"** technique is used to 
charge the batteries. It means that the duration of charging is extremely long (tens of hours) but you cannot overcharge the batteries.

A suggested protocol of recharging is to charge the device while you are at your workplace and avoid leaving it charging for days and days for safety measures.
