# Printed circuit boards

There are two available printed circuit board (PCB) designs. One features two plated through holes (PTH) which need to be soldered with a copper wire to create electrodes. This PCB is easier in manufacturing and handling.
The other PCB design features two dedicated electrodes. The issue with this design, which is the original design, is that you need to explicitly specify to the manufacturer that these electrodes must cover
the whole area without any solder mask left on electrode pads. Otherwise, the solder mask is going to be taller than electrodes and a slide might not be able to touch the pads. Yet, this version also has PTH as a back-up.

Both use USB B connector for charging but feel free to swap those for whatever suits you.
